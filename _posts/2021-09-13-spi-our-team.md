SPI our team at ISSI
======
SPI team members A. Halford, L. Blum, D. Sibeck, and M. Shumko are apart of a new ISSI team Dynamics of Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron Wave Activity in the Earth's Magnetosphere. ISSI stands for International Space Science Institute and they are a group that brings teams of international scientists together to collaborate on specific topics. Our team is co-led by R. Bhanu and A. Halford. The goal will be to bring experts on electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves (or EMIC waves) together to upate our collective knowledge with a review paper. Review papers are fantastic resources which bring together a high level look at the current state of the field, pull together recent and historical work on a topic, and place it into perspective. In our current scientific culture, there is a near continuous stream of new papers - and review papers help bring together in the hopes that we won't miss any important papers and/or topics, and others can use this as a guide to quickly find resources and references.
