SPI our team at ISSI
======
SPI team members A. Halford, L. Blum, D. Sibeck, and M. Shumko are a part of a new ISSI team Dynamics of Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron Wave Activity in the Earth's Magnetosphere. ISSI stands for International Space Science Institute. They are a group that brings teams of international scientists together to collaborate on specific topics. Our team is co-led by R. Bhanu and A. Halford. The goal will be to bring experts on electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves (or EMIC waves) together to update our collective knowledge with a review paper. In our current scientific culture, there is a near-continuous stream of new papers. Review papers are fantastic resources. They bring together a high-level look at the field's current state, pull together recent and historical work on a topic, and place it into perspective. Others can then use these reviews as a guide to quickly find resources and references.
