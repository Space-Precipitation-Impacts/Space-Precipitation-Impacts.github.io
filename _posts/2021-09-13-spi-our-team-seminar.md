SPI our team at the Magnetosphere Seminar
======
To understand the loss of particles from the magnetosphere and their impact on the atmosphere - you need an extensive range of experts. You need experts on the particles themselves, people who are experts on what affects the different particle populations, and then the impacts on the atmosphere. To understand all magnetosphere dynamics, you need an even larger group of researchers and experts. While you might not be an expert on everything, it is helpful to be aware of the topic areas and the lingo used to describe them. To help get different groups and experts talking to each other, Kyle Murphy and others started the Magnetospheric Seminar Series. Experts come and give overview talks about their favourite topics and answer questions. You can join these seminars on Mondays at noon Eastern. And no worries if you are busy then - they are all recorded and available online afterwards. Find out more about the [magnetosphere seminar series here](https://msolss.github.io/MagSeminars/)

Today Lauren Blum gave a talk on a subject near and dear to the SPI research goals. Lauren talked about energetic particle precipitation and some of the drivers which cause them to be lost from the magnetosphere. [You can check out Lauren's talk here](https://youtu.be/f8WGTitJQxA)
