SPI our team at the Collaborative Meeting for GSFC and JPL
======
SPI team members from Goddard attended and presented at a joint collaboration finding workshop between the ionosphere, thermosphere, mesosphere groups from Goddard and the Jet Propoulsion Laboratory. It's always so easy to start working in your own little bubble. So having these workshops to actively look for and work towards creating new collaborations is so very important and very revitalizing. Getting new ideas and learning about new ongoing work is fantastic. We found so many areas of overlap that we're already planning follow on workshops focused on very specific topics. Stay tuned to find out more about what comes out of these new relationships!
