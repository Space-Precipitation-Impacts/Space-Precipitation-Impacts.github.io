SPI Equity within Heliophysics
======
Every Fall there is an increase in requests for recommendation letters as undergraduate students start looking at graduate schools, new jobs, and new experiences. Award season is ever ongoing and provides an opprotunity to make sure our collaborators know how much we value their work and efforts. Letters of support and recomendations can make or break a person's chances at being chosen whether for a graduate position or a big award. Unfortunetly, our unconcious biases can leak into our letters and work against our attempts at helping our colleauges get ahead. 

A new group lead by Angeline Burrell is providing a new service, the Equitable Leters in Space Physics (ELSP) to review recommendation, nomination, and supporting letters to help remove these unconsious biases. SPI team member Alexa Halford is currently serving on the committee and is dedicated to helping improve the diversity within the heliophysics community. If you would like to find out more about how to use this service, serve as a reviewer, or find other resources, check out https://equitableletterssp.github.io/ELSP/index.html
