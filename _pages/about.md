SPI is an interdisciplinary and cross-institutional research group focused on studying the drivers and dynamics of low (<10 keV), medium (10-100 keV), and high energy (>100 keV) precipitation and their subsequent impacts on the ionosphere and upper atmosphere. SPI uses a unique combination of data analysis, theory and model development, and simulations within our team of experts to address three focussed but interconnected science questions investigating **(A) the drivers of**, **(B) the variation in**, and **(C) the impacts of precipitation**. SPI's three high-level science objectives are:

(A) How do the drivers of and pathways to energetic particle precipitation change under varying geomagnetic and solar wind conditions?

(B) How does the amount of low, medium, and high energy ion and electron precipitation change with varying physical drivers under different solar wind and geomagnetic conditions?

(C) What effect does precipitation have on satellite drag, and how does this vary with the dynamics of solar wind driving and geomagnetic activity?


Our Code of Conduct and Shared values will help us make sure we have strong collaborative teams. [Read more about them here](Code-of-conduct.md).
