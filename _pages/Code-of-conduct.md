### Code of conduct for the meeting and collaborations:

 
We believe this collaboration should maintain a professional, positive, and inclusive experience for everyone, in both an in person and virtual environment. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all colleagues. We expect everyone to treat each other with respect, dignity, and courtesy. We expect that people will refrain from demanding or discriminatory behaviour and speech. Everyone should be mindful of their surroundings and remember that this workplace is where professional interactions are expected and should be the norm. Unacceptable behaviour includes intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct. If there is an issue that arises or you become aware of, please let a the relevant HQ representative for the proposal, or other trusted individuals within the proposal/mission/collaboration team know.  Keep in mind that when communicating virtually, many clues we typically derive from nuances of emotion, tone, and body language are lost. This makes it all the more important to consider the content and tone of contact and communication to avoid misinterpretation or miscommunication. Respect copying and use of presented materials and ideas as indicated by AGU's Guidelines on Photography and Social Media, including knowing when you may need to obtain permission regarding copying materials. And in the end, Be Accountable: When we as team members fail to meet these guidelines, we will work together to identify problems and adjust policy and practice together. 


This code of conduct is derived from our shared values and aims to support and enable these values:   
        	        	        	                       
**Inclusion:** Innovative, creative, and robust science and deep knowledge integration is completed through effective collaborations where all voices are valued and included.

**Diversity:**  As our interdisciplinary teams bring different perspectives, new methodologies, and experiences together, we can more effectively accomplish translational breakthroughs to our science objectives.

**Honesty:** Identification of the limits of what can be derived from our current physical understanding, data, and methodologies improves our scientific understanding and how our science impacts our lives.

**Self-reflection and accountability:** We acknowledge that we all carry our own biases and that we are human and imperfect. With this understanding, we acknowledge that self-reflection and disclosure to ourselves of our own biases and holding ourselves accountable can help us become better mentors, collaborators, and ultimately better scientists.

**An environment of trust:** In order for the free exchange of new innovative ideas, there needs to be an environment and culture of trust. While we feel that the above values and guidelines should cultivate this environment, it is essential to state that trust within the team is highly valued to ensure a healthy and safe collaborative ecosystem.
