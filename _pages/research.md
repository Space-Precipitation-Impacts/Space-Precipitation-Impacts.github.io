The Space Precipitation and Impacts (SPI) research community includes a diverse set of experts all working towards one goal. Understanding what drives precipitation from the magnetosphere into the atmosphere, and how that precipitation impacts the different layers within the atmosphere. We have adopted an open science and team of teams approach to our collaboration. Our teams are set up around common research areas and include: 1) Drivers of precipitation,  2) Low energy precipitation, 3) Medium energy precipitaiton, 4) High energy precipitation, and 5) Impacts of precipitation. Many of SPI member's reseach interests span teams. These natural overlaps and permuable boundaries will help enable communication and knowledge transfer across teams. 

As our community starts up we will report back here on our progress and ways to get involved.
